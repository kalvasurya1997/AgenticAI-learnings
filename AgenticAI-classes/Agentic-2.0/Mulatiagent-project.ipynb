       "to run the mile in under 4 minutes today called Breaking4. While she crossed the line at a\n",
       "personal best of 4:06, today's attempt will always represent more than the pursuit of a specific\n",
       "singular time. We're super proud of Faith, our teams and everyone who supported her and we\n",
       "were all inspired by her effort. The Breaking4 journey will live on as a symbol of courage and\n",
       "ambition. You have to dare to try, and I deeply admire the monumental effort.\n",
       "What it showed is that no other brand offers athletes the depth of expertise that we can. No\n",
       "other brand dreams as big as we can, and more than anything, no other brand inspires 8 billion\n",
       "potential athletes to believe. Faith's historic attempt comes at a unique moment for NIKE and\n",
       "our consumers. as the sportswear industry continues to operate under geopolitical volatility and\n",
       "tariff uncertainty.\n",
       "Specifically to our business, the results we're reporting today in Q4 and in FY '25 are not up to\n",
       "the NIKE standard. But as we said 90 days ago, the work we're doing to reposition the\n",
       "business through our Win Now actions is having an impact. From here, we expect our business\n",
       "results to improve. It's time to turn the page.\n",
       "Just look at the pace of change we've embraced and the progress we made over the last 8\n",
       "months. It all started on October 14, my first day back at NIKE, with an all-employee meeting\n",
       "and a declaration to our teammates that we are a sport and a growth company and that we will\n",
       "put the athlete at the center of everything that we do and every decision that we make.\n",
       "In December, we aligned our teams against the 5 Win Now actions: culture, product,\n",
       "marketing, marketplace, and our ground game with a sharp focus on 5 key sports, 3 key\n",
       "countries and 5 key cities. We also set out to aggressively rightsize 3 very important\n",
       "franchises, Air Force 1, Dunk, and the AJ1 and to return NIKE Digital to a premium destination.\n",
       "With our teams executing against our actions, I flattened my leadership structure and made\n",
       "changes to 11 of my 15 direct reports. We pulled the lever we could pull the fastest, investing\n",
       "heavily in big sport moments and key product launches to win back our brand voice. That\n",
       "energy has ignited NIKE performance products with consumers, which is helping us to better\n",
       "balance our portfolio.\n",
       "Reclaiming our voice in sports has turned out to be the jump start we needed for our team\n",
       "culture, too. I see the fight in our teams. We believe and we're competing. A sharp sport point\n",
       "of view and a less promotional NIKE marketplace is helping us gain the confidence\n",
       "of wholesale partners. I'm personally meeting with our partners to reaffirm that we're prioritizing\n",
       "and investing in their businesses. We're also strategically adding more points of distribution to\n",
       "be in the path of a wider range of consumers.\n",
       "NIKE Direct is showing early signs of being a more premium destination, especially when tied\n",
       "to a sport moment, a key product launch or a NIKE-created on-the-ground activation. To\n",
       "accelerate our Win Now actions, the next step is to realign into dedicated cross-functional\n",
       "teams by sport. We're organizing into a sport offense to have deeper relationships with the\n",
       "athletes we serve, to gain better insights, to drive sports-specific innovation, telling inspiring\n",
       "stories and differentiating ourselves in the marketplace.\n",
       "Instead of a men's, women's and kids' construct, NIKE, Jordan and Converse teams will now\n",
       "come to work every day with a mission to create the most innovative and coveted product,\n",
       "footwear, apparel and accessories for the specific athletes they serve. These sports- obsessed\n",
       "teams will create greater dimension and distinction for our 3 brands, will make us more\n",
       "competitive and will accelerate our growth.\n",
       "We'll pay it off in an integrated marketplace of our own design. We'll invest in NIKE Direct\n",
       "digitally and physically, and thoughtfully segment wholesale partners to serve sport-specific\n",
       "consumers across channels and up-and-down price points.\n",
       "Strategically, sharper marketplace segmentation in a sport offense allows us to deliver unique\n",
       "assortments and storytelling opportunities across different channels and partners to better\n",
       "serve our consumers and to help drive profitable, sustainable growth for our partners.\n",
       "We're already moving on a number of these fronts. To better serve wholesale partners, we're in\n",
       "the process of hiring retail marketing, visual merchandising and account management\n",
       "teammates. And in NIKE Direct, we're getting into the rhythm of lining up against sport\n",
       "moments and key product launches. Two wholesale partnership examples this quarter were\n",
       "through with DICK's through our 24/7 Training Collection, and with JD through the Air Max 95.\n",
       "The result: elevated presentations, better consumer connections and increased sell-throughs.\n",
       "Earlier this month, our NIKE L.A. door at The Grove was home base for a highly successful\n",
       "global After Dark run series. Hosting thousands of women runners in L.A. created energy\n",
       "throughout the week. The day before the race, we captured our best sales day at The Grove in\n",
       "3 years. And at the conclusion of the inspiring French Open finals, NIKE Digital posted the pre-,\n",
       "during and post-game looks of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner with a 30% bump in day-to-\n",
       "day sell-through. Consumer-right, sport-led assortments, in- the-moment storytelling and\n",

       "Okay, let me spend a few minutes talking through our approach to the newly issued tariffs.\n",
       "Over the past 50 years, NIKE has built a globally expansive supply chain that is responsive\n",
       "and resilient. We have strong relationships with our factory partners, and our leadership team\n",
       "is experienced in managing through disruption.\n",
       "NIKE has consistently been a top payer of U.S. duties, with an average duty rate on footwear\n",
       "imported into the United States in the mid-teens range. Therefore, these tariffs represent a new\n",
       "and meaningful cost headwind, and we are taking actions that balance the consumer, our\n",
       "partners, our Win Now actions as well as the long-term positioning of our brands in the\n",
       "marketplace.\n",
       "First, we will optimize our sourcing mix and allocate production differently across countries to\n",

       "Chinese products imported into the United States, manufacturing capacity and capability in\n",
       "China remains important to our global source base.\n",
       "Currently, China represents roughly 16% of the footwear we import into the United States, and\n",
       "we expect this to reduce to the high single-digit range by the end of fiscal '26 with supply from\n",
       "China reallocated to other countries around the world.\n",
       "Second, we are partnering with our suppliers and our retail partners to mitigate this structural\n",
       "cost increase in order to minimize the overall impact to the consumer. These partner\n",
       "arrangements will come into effect at different times throughout fiscal '26.\n",
       "Third, as part of our regular approach to seasonal planning, we have implemented a surgical\n",
       "price increase in the United States with phased implementation beginning in fall '25.\n",
       "And last, we will evaluate corporate cost reduction as appropriate. However, our highest priority\n",
       "right now continues to be reigniting brand momentum through sport and stabilizing our\n",
       "business.\n",
       "With the new tariff rates in place today, we estimate a gross incremental cost increase to NIKE\n",
       "of approximately $1 billion. We intend to fully mitigate the impact of these headwinds over time\n",
       "as we implement and annualize the actions I've outlined. For fiscal '26, we expect this financial\n",

       "Today, I will also share some additional insights for how we expect our Win Now actions to\n",
       "shape elements of our financial performance throughout fiscal '26. Momentum is building in our\n",

       "As Elliott said, our holiday order book is up versus the prior year with growth in North America,\n",

       "deleveraged relative to historical sales growth with improving gross margins and disciplined\n",
       "expense management over time. We have moderated our share repurchases in the near term\n",
       "due to a more dynamic and uncertain environment as well as the impact of the Win Now\n",

       "Overall, we are pleased with the progress our teams are making against our Win Now actions.\n",
       "As I said last quarter, these are the building blocks for NIKE to return to sustainable profitable\n",

       "Last, I'll finish with our first quarter guidance. We will continue navigating through several\n",
       "factors that create uncertainty in this operating environment, including for the consumer, and so\n",
       "our outlook reflects our best assessment of these factors based on the data we have available\n",

       "approximately 350 to 425 basis points. This includes approximately 100 basis points negative\n",
       "impact due to the new tariffs based on the rates that are in place today. We expect Q1 SG&A\n",
       "dollars to be up low single digits. We expect other income and expense, including net interest\n",
       "income, to be 0 to $10 million in the first quarter. And we expect the tax rate for the full year to\n",
       "be 19% to 20% due primarily to anticipated changes in earnings mix.\n",
       "With that, I'll pass it back to Elliott.\n",
       "Elliott J. Hill\n",
       "Before taking questions, I want to share some final thoughts on another historic sports moment\n",
       "this past quarter, Rory McIlroy's Masters win. I was lucky enough to be at Augusta earlier that\n",

       "ever accomplished. He was also battling a decade-long drought of winning a major. He's had\n",
       "his share of close calls and heartbreaks and more than enough doubters. Sunday's final round\n",

       "a double bogey. Lesson learned.\n",
       "He played better when he was attacking. Despite another up-and-down round, the win was still\n",
       "in his grasp. All he needed to do was sink a 5-foot putt on the 18th. He stepped up and missed,\n",
       "wide left. He was heading to a playoff. His caddie, Harry Diamond, his lifelong friend and\n",
       "biggest supporter, knew just what to say. \"You would have given your right arm to be in the\n",
